# GRADED FUNCTION
# You should edit this cell.

# In this function, you will return the transformation matrix T,
# having built it out of an orthonormal basis set E that you create from Bear's Basis
# and a transformation matrix in the mirror's coordinates TE.
def build_reflection_matrix(bearBasis) : # The parameter bearBasis is a 2×2 matrix that is passed to the function.
    # Use the gsBasis function on bearBasis to get the mirror's orthonormal basis.
    E = gsBasis(bearBasis)
    # Write a matrix in component form that performs the mirror's reflection in the mirror's basis.
    # Recall, the mirror operates by negating the last component of a vector.
    # Replace a,b,c,d with appropriate values
    TE = np.array([[1, 0],
                   [0, -1]])
    # Combine the matrices E and TE to produce your transformation matrix.
    T = E @ TE @ transpose(E)
    # Finally, we return the result. There is no need to change this line.
    return T

# First load Pyplot, a graph plotting library.

# (When you've done the exercise once, see what happns when you change Bear's basis.)

# This line uses your code to build a transformation matrix for us to use.
T = build_reflection_matrix(bearBasis)

# Bear is drawn as a set of polygons, the vertices of which are placed as a matrix list of column vectors.

# We'll make new lists of vertices by applying the T matrix you've calculated.
