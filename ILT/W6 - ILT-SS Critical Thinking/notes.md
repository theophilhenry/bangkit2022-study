An e-commerce company, FGH, recently conducted an internal review of their website. It found out that several items, such as travel bags and clothings across various brands, generally generated lower clicks. The company targeted millennials who are mostly fashion-conscious who tend to compare multiple items, hence the results came off as a shock to them. 
Customer service also received many questions and complaints from users, asking “why the product selection for fashion items is so few” despite the company partnering with hundreds of suppliers. After looking at the analytics, not many users have been using search feature, too. For a content-heavy website that offers various products, this becomes a question.

Who: Millennial users, Customer Service team, IT team

Situation:
The company already partners with hundreds of fashion item suppliers
Various fashion items having only a few clicks
Customer service received complaints that users don’t have access to various fashion items

Complication:
Analytics showed that not many users have been using search feature
Users haven’t used the search feature

Problem Statement:
Why can’t users find the items they’re looking for that we have in our platform?
