Say there's 
company A : need 3 ML,
company B : need 1 ML, 2 MD

My name is X and I'm from Machine Learning.
My first  team : X, Y, Z apply to company A
My second team : X, K, L apply to company B

There's a chance that my team will get accepted to both A and B.

Seeing from the previous answer from Mr Yoza, if I can be only accepted to one (choosen by bangkit team), and say bangkit choose for me to be in company A. Isnt it unfair for my second team? Just because I cannot be choosen again to be accepted in company B?

If that's not the case, and both of my team can be accepted. Which team will I join (The first one or the second one)? 
Say I pick to join team one. Who's going to take my position on the second team? Can my second team pick another ML person?

15 team in company or not,

Notes 
Untuk capstone, kalo mau dapet top, itu ambil project yang gak banyak orang ambil
Lalu utk penolakan proposal, itu gak sepenuhnya ditolak. Lebih ke di revisi
