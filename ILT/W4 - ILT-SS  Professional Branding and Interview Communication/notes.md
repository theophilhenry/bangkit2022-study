### STAR Example

During my internship at XYZ company, I had been assigned project C that was originally scheduled for completion in 30-days, however, my supervisor instructed to have it completed within 20-days. At the time, I was simultaneously working on my thesis and I had organized my schedule around the initial timeline. After further review of the task, I realized it was possible to complete within a shorter time frame, however, it required requesting my supervisor to provide her feedback within 24-hours 

instead of the initially scheduled 48-hour timeframe. I also adjusted my schedule so that during that 24-hour project feedback period, I could work on my thesis. I successfully completed my project and thesis on time, by prioritizing my tasks, finding solutions and reaching an effective working process with my supervisor.
