## Adaptability <hr/>

First we game!

Think about a time I had to learn a new task at college,
what did I do to speed up the learning process?

For me :
- Learn about the task overall, in a big picture,
- I like to use video,
so my step is first, other people's video first to see other point of view, then I can follow the learning in the college better.

#### Think about the time when someone asked you to do something outside of your job description.

I usually do design, but suddenly I asked to be a master of ceremony, in front of orang penting. 

#### Are you someone who can adapt to differen work environemnts?
Not immedeatly

## Why Adaptability is Critical <hr>
In order to survive!
