CRON job : schedule scripts on UNIX-based OS
Say we want to audit who's been launching the CRON jobs

>>> import sys
>>> logfile = sys.argv[1]
>>> with open(logfile) as file:
>>>   for line in file:
>>>     if "CRON" not in line: continue
>>>     result = re.search(r"USER \((\w+)\)", line)
>>>     print(result[1])


== Better use of Dict ==
>>> name = "something"
>>> username = {}
>>> username[name] = username.get(name, 0) + 1
