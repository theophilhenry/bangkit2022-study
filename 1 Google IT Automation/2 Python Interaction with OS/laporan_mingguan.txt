Today I've learnt a lot, because I had to push the course from week 3 to 5 in Using Python with OS. Them material is so amazing and insightful so I want to learn it slowly. It's so relevant with the problem I've faced over the course of my programming life. I grasped some old concept that I just knew now, and I've also learnt new things. The one I strugle a lot in this course 2 is the expression that I always forgot. I forgot that I can directly loop red files. Well let's recap from the first day, I did know python before, so the first course I speed it up 2x and I'm doing fine. I've manage to get the first certificate quickly. By day three I've finished the module. It's suprising to refresh all the knowledge that I've learnt in college, but there's still something missing that I got new from this course. I had so much fun doing the first course. Then comes DAY 4.. the second course. A lot information got in very quickly, and I can only process so much. Automating, Reading Writing Files, Regex, Data & Processes, and Testing, all of it was hard, but I manage to understand them all. The only thing that I struggle with throughout this was to remember that "OH I FORGOT I COULD DO THAT". If I read another person code, I should be able to recognize and know what that code does. Still needs to experiment on my own and do the exercise again. Overall I'm very satisfied of my progress. If I had the time to rewind this week and reorganize it, I think I would do the same. The knowledge got stuck in my brain better this way xD .. I hope I can finish week 6 and 7 by tomorrow. And then continue to github course.
