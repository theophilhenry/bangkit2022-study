= Try-Except =
Trying to validate a file, have sooo many conditions!
Use try-except

`
try:
  pass
except OSerror:
  pass
`

= Raising Errors =
Like "throw"ing an error
>>> raise [some_error_type]("message!!")

= Assertion =
Assert is like an "Asumption"
Assert Error : Verify that a conditional expression is true and if its false it raises AssertionError.
`
  assert type(username) == str, "username must be a string"
`
Heads up!
Assertion will get removed from our code if we ask the intepreter to optimize it to run faster.

Rules
> Raise : to check conditions that expect to happen during runtime.
> Assert : to verify situations that aren't expected but might cause our code to missbehave.


= Testing Errors =
>>> assertRaises(ValueError, validate_user, "user", 1) # ([error_expected], [function_name], [any_param]...)
>>> assertRaises([], AssertionError)
