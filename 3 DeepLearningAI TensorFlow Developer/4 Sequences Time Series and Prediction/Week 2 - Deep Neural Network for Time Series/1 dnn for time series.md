## Deep Neural Network for Time Series <hr>
How machine learning helps some this problem?
We divide our data into features and labels.

the features is a number of values in the series, with the label is the next value.
We call the number of values that will treat as our feature, the window size. (we train window of data)

For example, we take our time series data, say 30 days at a time. We'll use 30 values as the features, and the next value is the label.
